"""Isolated worktree + venv harness for code evolution.

A code repair must be measured against the *repaired* code and nothing else.
Two failure modes make that harder than it looks, and this module exists to
foreclose both:

1. **Never touch the user's checkout.** Repairs happen in a throwaway ``git
   worktree`` of the target repo, created from a base ref. The user's working
   copy is never written to.

2. **Never measure a Frankenstein import.** The target repo (Hermes) is
   installed *editable*: its import finder hardcodes a package→original-path
   map. Putting the worktree on ``PYTHONPATH`` is not enough — submodule
   resolution can still fall through to the original tree, so the loop would
   score a mix of repaired and original code. The robust fix is to make the
   worktree *authoritative*: a dedicated venv with ``pip install -e <worktree>``
   so the editable finder points at the worktree. ``--system-site-packages
   --no-deps`` keeps that install cheap by inheriting the user's already-built
   dependencies instead of reinstalling them.

   Because that mechanism has version- and ordering-dependent edge cases, it is
   never *trusted* — :meth:`WorktreeEnv.assert_authoritative` empirically
   confirms that the ``tools`` package resolves from inside the worktree before
   any verdict is believed, and aborts loudly otherwise. Once the ``tools``
   package object resolves to the worktree, every ``tools.X`` submodule import
   searches ``tools.__path__`` in the worktree — and a repair only ever mutates
   one ``tools/`` file — so that single check is sufficient for the repair's
   blast radius.
