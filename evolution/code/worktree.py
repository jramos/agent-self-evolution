"""Isolated worktree + venv harness for code evolution.

A code repair must be measured against the *repaired* code and nothing else.
Two failure modes make that harder than it looks, and this module exists to
foreclose both:

1. **Never touch the user's checkout.** Repairs happen in a throwaway ``git
   worktree`` of the target repo, created from a base ref. The user's working
   copy is never written to.

2. **Never measure a Frankenstein import.** The target repo (Hermes) is
   installed *editable*: its import finder hardcodes a package→original-path
   map. Putting the worktree on ``PYTHONPATH`` is not enough — submodule
   resolution can still fall through to the original tree, so the loop would
   score a mix of repaired and original code. The robust fix is to make the
   worktree *authoritative*: a dedicated venv with ``pip install -e <worktree>``
   so the editable finder points at the worktree. ``--system-site-packages
   --no-deps`` keeps that install cheap by inheriting the user's already-built
   dependencies instead of reinstalling them.

   Because that mechanism has version- and ordering-dependent edge cases, it is
   never *trusted* — :meth:`WorktreeEnv.assert_authoritative` empirically
   confirms that the ``tools`` package resolves from inside the worktree before
   any verdict is believed, and aborts loudly otherwise. Once the ``tools``
   package object resolves to the worktree, every ``tools.X`` submodule import
   searches ``tools.__path__`` in the worktree — and a repair only ever mutates
   one ``tools/`` file — so that single check is sufficient for the repair's
   blast radius.

        because the parser returns an empty set for any output it does not
        recognise, and an empty set reads as "nothing failed": a timed-out, killed,
        or uncollectable run would otherwise certify a repair it never exercised.
        Only exit 0 (all passed), 1 (ran, some failed) and 5 (nothing collected)
        make a complete statement about what failed. 5 stays authoritative because
        callers already reason about "no tests collected" explicitly; excluding it
        here would change how the harvester classifies candidates rather than how
        the gate scores them.

        Mirrors the SWE-bench env, which treats an id it cannot account for as
        failing so it cannot certify as fixed.
