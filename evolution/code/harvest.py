"""Real-bug harvester for the code-evolution measurement campaign.

Mines a target repo's git history for authentic tool bugs. A commit that fixed a
tool — touching both ``tools/X.py`` and its ``tests/tools/test_X.py`` — pairs the
PARENT commit's (buggy) tool source with the fix commit's test. That parent state
is a real bug iff the pre-fix source fails ≥1 test the upstream fix passes. The
fix commit is kept as a ground-truth **oracle**: the campaign verifies a repair by
behavioral match to the upstream fix, so the harvest never needs the held-out
split (whose independence is limited).

Records **refs, not blobs** — sources are re-materialized from git at run time.
Validity is established in the real :class:`WorktreeEnv` (full env + conftest), not
a bare tmpdir, so the harvester is not limited to self-contained tools.
