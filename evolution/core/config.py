"""Configuration and skill-source discovery.

Skill discovery moved from a single hardcoded Hermes Agent layout to a
pluggable SkillSource list (see evolution/core/skill_sources.py).
The default list is built by sniffing the environment: HERMES_AGENT_REPO,
~/.claude/plugins/cache, plus any explicit --skill-source-dir from the CLI.
