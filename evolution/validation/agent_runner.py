"""Agent runner protocol for closed-loop validation.

A runner takes one task and returns what the agent actually did. The
validator scores the result against the task's expected / forbidden
tool sets — never trusting the agent's exit code, which is unreliable
across backends.

    ``tool_calls_seq`` is the ordered list of tool *names* (not the full
    tool_call dicts) the agent invoked during the session. The validator
    only needs names for the expected / forbidden membership tests.

    ``tool_calls_with_args`` carries the same calls in order as
    ``{"name", "arguments"}`` dicts (arguments parsed from the
    LLM-emitted JSON). The compound-verdict Layer 2 judge needs the
    argument payloads — e.g. the content of a ``memory(action='save')``
    call — which ``tool_calls_seq`` discards.

    ``error`` is set when the runner itself failed to drive the agent
    (subprocess timeout, no session JSON written, parse failure). It's
    distinct from "agent invoked a tool that failed" — that's still a
    valid run, just one where the agent struggled. Tasks with ``error``
    are counted as *abstentions* in the report, not as failures, so a
    transient timeout doesn't masquerade as evidence of regression.
