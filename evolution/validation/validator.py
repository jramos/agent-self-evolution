"""ClosedLoopValidator — orchestrate baseline vs. evolved against a task suite.

The validator owns the dangerous part of the harness: mutating the
user's hermes-agent install in place. Defenses:

  - ``fcntl.flock`` on the target file's parent dir: concurrent runs
    fail fast rather than corrupting each other's restores.
  - ``.cl_backup`` written atomically + ast-validated. On startup the
    harness refuses to start if a stale, valid backup exists.
  - sha256 verification between every task: an in-suite agent that
    mutates the spliced file (YOLO mode + terminal) aborts the phase
    rather than silently corrupting later tasks' baselines.
  - ``try/finally`` restore from backup is the primary path. If
    everything else fails, the OS releases the flock on process death.
