# Operating the triage sentinel

The sentinel is the **supply side** of the code-evolution loop: it scans a target
repo's recent git stream for bugs the validated repair loop *could* fix, ranks
them, and writes a triage queue. It is **propose-only** — it never evolves code or
opens a PR. A human reads the queue and decides what, if anything, to attempt.

The repair loop (`evolution.code.campaign`) is the **consumer**. The sentinel finds
work; you choose when to spend on it.

## Two steps, one of which costs money

| Step | Command | Cost | Who triggers |
|------|---------|------|--------------|
| **Scan** (rank candidates → queue) | `python -m evolution.monitor --repo <repo>` | **$0** (pure git, no LLM) | safe to schedule |
| **Attempt** (run the repair loop on the top K) | `… --attempt-top K --max-cost-usd <cap>` | **spends** (LLM calls) | manual, gated, cost-capped |

The scan never spends. The attempt is the only step that calls an LLM, so it stays
a deliberate, capped, human-triggered action — **never scheduled** (see below).

## Scanning

On demand:

```bash
python -m evolution.monitor --repo /path/to/target-repo --since-days 90
```

Or via the wrapper (writes a timestamped dir plus a stable `latest` pointer):

```bash
scripts/monitor_scan.sh /path/to/target-repo
# SENTINEL_SINCE_DAYS=30 scripts/monitor_scan.sh /path/to/target-repo
```

Each run writes to `output/monitor/<timestamp>/`:
- `triage_queue.json` — machine-readable, jq-aggregable.
- `triage_report.md` — the human-readable ranked table + the ready-to-run attempt command.

## Reading the queue

Each candidate row carries:

| field | meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `rank` | position after sorting (see ranking below) |
| `kind` | `dependency_regression` or `bug_fix` |
| `tool` / `test` | the tool source and the test file that pins its behavior |
| `fix_sha` / `parent_sha` | the upstream fix commit and its buggy parent (the oracle handle) |
| `committed_at` | committer date of the fix (also the recency sort key) |
| `score` | ranking weight (`dependency_regression` = 2.0, `bug_fix` = 1.0) |

**Ranking** is git-only and intentionally cheap: dependency-regressions first, then
most recent. Difficulty and value are *not* estimated here — that needs a worktree —
so a high rank means "look at this first," not "this will repair."

### Honest caveat on `dependency_regression`

This label is **noisy**. It fires when the fix commit also touched a dependency
manifest (`pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `requirements.txt`, …) — not when a dependency
version was actually bumped and broke a tool. A supply analysis over a year of one
active repo found **zero** clean, tool-local dependency-version regressions: the
manifest-touching commits were broad migrations (dozens of files) that don't
reproduce as a single-tool repair, or feature additions. So treat a
`dependency_regression` tag as "this commit happened to touch a manifest," and judge
the candidate on its actual diff — do not assume it is a genuine version regression.

## Attempting the top candidates (the spend)

When you decide a few candidates are worth the spend:

```bash
python -m evolution.monitor --repo /path/to/target-repo \
    --attempt-top 3 --max-cost-usd 5.0
```

This reuses the validated repair loop (worktree → repair → oracle gate) on the top K
and annotates each queue row with an `attempt` block. It still **never opens a PR** —
it records whether the loop *could* produce an oracle-matching fix. You read the
verdict and decide what to deploy by hand.

Verdicts in the annotated `triage_queue.json`:

| `attempt.status` | meaning |
|------------------|---------|
| `attempted` (+ `correct_seeds`/`seeds`, `deploy_reachable`) | the loop ran; `deploy_reachable: true` means a majority of seeds produced an oracle-matching fix |
| `not_valid` | the parent doesn't cleanly fail what the fix passes — not a clean single-tool bug |
| `source_missing` / `too_large` / `worktree_failed` | skipped before repair (source gone, too big for a whole-file rewrite, or isolation setup failed) |
| `cost_ceiling` | the `--max-cost-usd` cap was hit; remaining candidates were not attempted |

`--max-cost-usd` is a hard ceiling: the run aborts cleanly with a partial, still-valid
queue when cumulative LLM cost crosses it.

## Scheduling the scan (opt-in, macOS launchd)

The scan is $0, so a periodic refresh is safe. This is **opt-in** — nothing is
installed for you.

1. Copy the template and fill in the two placeholders:

   ```bash
   sed -e "s#__REPO_ROOT__#$(pwd)#g" \
       -e "s#__TARGET_REPO__#/path/to/target-repo#g" \
       scripts/com.agent-self-evolution.sentinel-scan.plist.template \
       > ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.agent-self-evolution.sentinel-scan.plist
   ```

2. Enable / disable:

   ```bash
   launchctl load   ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.agent-self-evolution.sentinel-scan.plist   # enable
   launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.agent-self-evolution.sentinel-scan.plist   # disable
   ```

The template runs weekly (Mondays 09:00) and logs to `output/monitor/sentinel-scan.log`.

**Never put `--attempt-top` in the scheduled job.** A schedule must only scan; the
spend step stays manual. The wrapper and template are written to enforce this, and a
copy-paste that adds `--attempt-top` would turn a free job into unsupervised spend.

**Cron alternative** (any Unix): `0 9 * * 1 /path/to/repo/scripts/monitor_scan.sh /path/to/target-repo`

### Retention

Each scan writes a new `output/monitor/<timestamp>/` and never deletes old ones, so
the audit trail is preserved. Prune periodically to keep the directory bounded — e.g.
keep the most recent 12:

```bash
ls -dt output/monitor/2* | tail -n +13 | xargs rm -rf
```

## What the sentinel never does

- It never edits the target repo, evolves code, or opens a PR.
- It never spends on a schedule — only `--attempt-top`, run by you, spends.
- It never decides a deploy — it surfaces candidates and verdicts; the human deploys.
