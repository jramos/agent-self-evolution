"""Project-wide pytest fixtures.

Many tests construct ``EvolutionConfig()`` and patch ``dspy.LM`` upstream
to avoid real network calls. With Hermes-aware LM resolution, the
resolver runs *before* ``dspy.LM`` at every construction site, so a CI
runner with no ``~/.hermes/config.yaml`` and no provider env vars hits
``HermesProviderError`` before the patched ``dspy.LM`` ever sees the
mock.

This autouse fixture:

1. Seeds a fake ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` for the test session so the resolver
   finds *something* and returns a deterministic ``ResolvedLM``.
2. Stubs the auth-check preflight to a no-op so existing tests that
   patch ``dspy.LM`` upstream don't accidentally make real
   ``litellm.completion`` calls during preflight (preflight bypasses
   dspy by design).

Tests that explicitly need the no-credentials path or want to exercise
preflight clear env vars / patch preflight in their own fixtures.

The fake key is never sent anywhere because every test that exercises
the LM construction path patches ``dspy.LM``, and preflight is stubbed
out below.
